# Update to ES6

## Introduction
In the following work it is intended to achieve, through the knowledge acquired in the ES6 course, update the code from ES5 to ES6. As an objective, it is expected to know the new updates of ES6, to use them in our class activities. 

## Methods
To start, the new ES6 updates began to be identified, with this the variables began to be updated since in ES5 the variables were initialized with **Var** as it's shown in the following:

~~~
var debug = Debug('projnotes');

var port  = normaLizePort(process.env.PORT || '3000')
~~~

in ES6 there was a change of variables, these went from being **Var** to **Const** or **Let**, this change can be seen in figure 2.

## Results
Finally, it was possible to convert from ES5 to ES6, the changes that were made were interpolation, import, export, arrow functions and initialization of variables. In the following link you can see the change to ES6 in the project.

## Discussions
A more modern code was obtained, which is ES6. In this new update, it is possible to reduce a quantity of code, making it more efficient. The changes added were interpolation, import, export, arrow functions, and initialization of variables.
